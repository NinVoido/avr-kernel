## Simple preemtive task scheduler for AVR microcontrollers
### Hardware specs:
 - Arduino UNO board
 - ATmega328P-PU microcontroller
### Software specs:
 - Written on C with usage of avr-libc and inline assembly
 - Compiled with avr-gcc
### Documentation:
I tried to document what I'd done, but the docs are not full. They mostly cover installation process of instruments I used and resources I found helpful. They can be accessed [here](/docs/README.md)
